    "Contours are defined as the line joining all the points along the boundary of an image that are having the same intensity. Contours come handy in shape analysis, finding the size of the object of interest, and object detection. OpenCV has findContour() function that helps in extracting the contours from the image.

But does it store all the coordinates? That is specified by this contour approximation method. If we pass cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_NONE, all the boundary points are stored. But actually, do we need all the points? For eg, if we have to find the contour of a straight line. We need just two endpoints of that line. This is what cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE does. It removes all redundant points and compresses the contour, thereby saving memory."
