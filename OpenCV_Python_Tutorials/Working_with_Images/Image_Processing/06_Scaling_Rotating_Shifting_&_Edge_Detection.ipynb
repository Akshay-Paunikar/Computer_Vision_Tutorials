    "#### What is Image Processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Image processing is the field of study and application that deals with modifying and analyzing digital images using computer algorithms. The goal of image processing is to enhance the visual quality of images, extract useful information, and make images suitable for further analysis or interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image Processing Using OpenCV\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a powerful and widely-used library for image processing and computer vision tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of functions and tools that facilitate the development of applications dealing with images and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "While taking photographs is as simple as pressing a button, processing and improving those images sometimes takes more than a few lines of code. That’s where image processing libraries like OpenCV come into play. OpenCV is a popular open-source package that covers a wide range of image processing and computer vision capabilities and methods. It supports multiple programming languages including Python, C++, and Java. OpenCV is highly tuned for real-time applications and has a wide range of capabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that resizing an image can reduce its quality. This is because the new pixels are calculated by interpolating between the existing pixels, and this can introduce some blurring."
